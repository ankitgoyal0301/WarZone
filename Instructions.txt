Steps:
1->One computer will run the server.py file 
2->If the players are not on the same pc as server then the players have to change the value of self.host to the ip address of the server.IP address of the server can be found by running the 'ipconfig' command on the server command prompt. 

This line gives the ip address

IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 172.31.71.138

Enter in this format
self.host='172.31.71.138'

3->Players will run Warzone.py file

NOTE:Warzone and Warzone2 are exactly same.You can run any of the file
